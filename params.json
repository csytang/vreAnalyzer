{"name":"vreAnalyzer: variability analyzer","tagline":"","body":"### vreAnalyzer\r\nvreAnalyzer is a research project with the goal of analyzing variability and extracting variants for product line use. In general, vreAnalyzer provides following analysis for a system in Java/.class based: call graph, control-flow graph, context-aware pointer analysis and binding-resolve.\r\n\r\nInstead of analyzing each variant for each feature combination in isolation, vreAnalyzer parses the entire source code containing all variability in a variability-aware fashion. By checking the context, pointer environment and other binding information, vreAnalyzer could return a list of potential variant indifferently. \r\n\r\n### Installation, Dependency, and Usage\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
